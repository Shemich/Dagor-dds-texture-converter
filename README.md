# Dagor-dds-texture-converter
Converts textures containing channels for specular, normals, and metalness, diffuse and ambient occlusion textures to png.

!I'm not sure if this works 100% correctly and properly, but it might speed up the process of configuring materials!

```_d``` separete to diffuse, ambient occlusion 

```_n``` separate to specular, normals, and metalness

# Run
1. Run exe
2. Select Dagor .dds textures with postfix ```_d``` or ```_n```
3. Select output folder
4. Subfolder ```converted_texture``` appears in selected folder
